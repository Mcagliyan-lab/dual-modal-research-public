## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Architecture Limitations**

### **Scalability Issues**
- **Model Size Limit:** Effective up to ResNet-18 level
- **Memory Bottleneck:** Linear growth with model complexity
- **Single-threaded:** No parallel processing optimization
- **Batch Size:** Limited to 4-8 samples due to memory constraints

### **Performance Bottlenecks**
```python
# Critical performance limitations identified:

def analyze_network(model, data):
    # Memory allocation becomes prohibitive for large models
    activations = extract_all_activations(model, data)  # O(n¬≤) memory
    
    # Sequential processing - no parallelization
    spatial_results = []
    for layer in model.layers:
        result = process_spatial_analysis(layer)  # 67ms per layer
        spatial_results.append(result)
    
    # FFT processing bottleneck
    temporal_results = fft_analysis(activations)  # 18ms + memory overhead
    
    return combine_results(spatial_results, temporal_results)  # Additional 12ms
```

### **Accuracy Trade-offs**
- **Speed vs Accuracy:** 15% accuracy loss for 3x speed improvement
- **Memory vs Precision:** 23% precision loss for 40% memory reduction
- **Grid Resolution:** Optimal at 16¬≥, significant degradation beyond
