## 2. How to Contribute?

### Bug Reports

If you found a bug, please create a bug report on GitHub Issues. Make sure to provide the following information in your bug report:

*   Clear and detailed steps on how to reproduce the bug.
*   Expected behavior and observed behavior.
*   Operating system, Python version, and library versions you are using.
*   Screenshots or error outputs if available.

### Feature Requests

If you want to suggest a new feature or improvement, please create a feature request on GitHub Issues. Include the following information in your requests:

*   Clearly describe what the feature is and what it aims to solve.
*   Explain why this feature is important.
*   Provide use cases or examples if available.

### Code Contributions

The general workflow for code contributions is as follows:

1.  Fork the repository.
2.  Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`).
3.  Make your changes and run tests. You can run tests using `pytest` in the project root directory.
4.  Ensure your code complies with the project's [Coding Standards](#4-coding-standards).
5.  Commit your changes (`git commit -m "feat: Add new feature"`). Use clear and descriptive commit messages.
6.  Push your changes to your forked repository (`git push origin feature/your-feature-name`).
7.  Open a Pull Request to the original repository. In your Pull Request, specify:
    *   A brief summary of the changes you made.
    *   The problem it solves or the feature it adds.
    *   Information about how it was tested.

### Documentation Contributions

Documentation updates and corrections are greatly appreciated. Help make the documentation more understandable, accurate, and comprehensive. Similar to code contributions, the Pull Request process is followed for documentation changes.

## 3. Development Environment Setup

To set up the project on your local machine, refer to the [Getting Started Guide](docs/getting-started.md).

---

## 4. Coding Standards

*   **Python:** Follow PEP 8 standards. Using formatters like `flake8` or `black` is recommended.
*   **Docstrings:** Provide descriptive docstrings (e.g., Google style) for all functions, classes, and important methods.
*   **Tests:** Write relevant unit or integration tests for each feature you add or modify. Your pull requests will be reviewed with automated CI/CD tests.
